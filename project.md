## **Project Description**

This project proposes developing an ML-powered Accounting Bot to revolutionize business transaction classification for tax purposes. The bot will leverage AI to automate this process, seamlessly interfacing with popular accounting software like QuickBooks Online (and potentially Xero).

**The Solution:**

- Train a classification model using a dataset of correctly categorized transactions. This model will then automatically categorize new, unclassified transactions.
- Focus on Python and its data science & machine learning libraries (PyTorch, Pandas, etc.).
- Explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced classification accuracy, although a smaller NLP (Natural Language Processing) classifier might be sufficient.

## **Programming Language(s)**

The primary language will be Python, utilizing libraries and frameworks for:

- Data Science
- AI/ML
- LLM models (potential)
- Various APIs

## **Hardware/Software Requirements**

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:**
  - PyTorch for deep learning
  - Pandas for data manipulation
  - Other machine learning and data science libraries as needed
- **APIs:**
  - QuickBooks Online API
  - Xero Accounting API (if applicable)
- **Tools:**
  - Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
  - Code interpreter
  - Web browser
  - DevOps tooling for CI/CD (continuous integration and deployment)
- **Computational Resources:** Local AI/ML server with high computational power for training, development, and deploying the model.

## **Current Work/Arrangement**

Currently, accountants and bookkeepers manually categorize transactions within software like QuickBooks. This is time-consuming and error-prone. This project aims to automate and improve accuracy using machine learning models.

**Technical Implementation:**

- Development will primarily focus on Python with AI and machine learning libraries for building the classifier.
- The system might interact with the QuickBooks Online API or utilize web scraping tools for data extraction and automation.
